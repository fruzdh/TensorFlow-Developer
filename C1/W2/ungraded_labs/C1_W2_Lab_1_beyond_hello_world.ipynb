This gave an explicit example of learned behavior. Of course, in that instance, it was a bit of overkill because it would have been easier to write the function `y=2x-1` directly instead of bothering with using machine learning to learn the relationship between `x` and `y`.\n","\n","But what about a scenario where writing rules like that is much more difficult -- for example a computer vision problem?
